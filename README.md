# Stock_Prediction

The "Stock-Prediction" repository implements an artificial intelligence neural network model designed for the precise prediction of stock prices by leveraging historical stock patterns. This project capitalizes on the historical data to create forecasts for future stock prices with a high degree of accuracy.

The codebase utilizes the Keras library to construct a sequential model that primarily employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. LSTM layers are chosen for their suitability in handling sequential data. The model is rigorously trained using a dataset containing historical stock prices and subsequently employed for making predictions on previously unseen data.

This undertaking forms the fundamental groundwork for the development of more advanced stock prediction models. Furthermore, it offers the potential for expansion to encompass supplementary features such as sentiment analysis, technical indicators, or fundamental data, all of which can contribute to elevating the precision of stock price predictions.
